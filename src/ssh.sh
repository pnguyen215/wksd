# read_ssh_conf function
# Reads and sources the content of an SSH configuration file.
#
# Usage:
#   read_ssh_conf <filename>
#
# Description:
#   The 'read_ssh_conf' function reads and sources the content of an SSH configuration file specified by the <filename> parameter.
#   This function is useful for dynamically loading SSH configurations from a file.
#
# Parameters:
#   - filename: The path to the SSH configuration file.
#
# Example:
#   read_ssh_conf ~/.ssh/config
#
# Recommendations:
#   - Ensure the specified file contains valid SSH configuration directives.
#   - Use this function to load SSH configurations dynamically based on different scenarios.
#
# Dependencies:
#   - None

# create_ssh_tunnel function
# Creates an SSH tunnel based on the configurations specified in an SSH configuration file.
#
# Usage:
#   create_ssh_tunnel <filename>
#
# Description:
#   The 'create_ssh_tunnel' function reads SSH configurations from the specified <filename> using the 'read_ssh_conf' function.
#   It then establishes an SSH tunnel based on the configured parameters.
#   Note: Modify the SSH tunneling command to suit your specific requirements.
#
# Parameters:
#   - filename: The path to the SSH configuration file.
#
# Example:
#   create_ssh_tunnel ~/.ssh/config
#
# Recommendations:
#   - Ensure the specified file contains valid SSH configuration directives.
#   - Adjust the SSH tunneling command according to your tunneling needs.
#   - Execute this function in a background process to run the tunnel in the background.
#
# Dependencies:

# verify_ssh_tunnel function
# Verifies the SSH tunnel connectivity based on the configurations specified in an SSH configuration file.
#
# Usage:
#   verify_ssh_tunnel <filename>
#
# Description:
#   The 'verify_ssh_tunnel' function reads SSH configurations from the specified <filename> using the 'read_ssh_conf' function.
#   It then attempts to establish an SSH connection to verify the tunnel connectivity.
#   Note: Modify the SSH connection command to suit your specific requirements.
#
# Parameters:
#   - filename: The path to the SSH configuration file.
#
# Example:
#   verify_ssh_tunnel ~/.ssh/config
#
# Recommendations:
#   - Ensure the specified file contains valid SSH configuration directives.
#   - Adjust the SSH connection command according to your verification needs.
#   - Execute this function to verify the connectivity of an existing SSH tunnel.
