# Note:
#   Ensure that you are in a Git repository before using this function.
#   The function provides a detailed conflict resolution process, allowing the user to interactively resolve conflicts in each conflicted file.
#   It uses the system's default editor to open conflicted files for resolution.
#   After resolving conflicts, the user must press Enter to continue the process.
#
# Recommendations:
#   This function is useful when you want to merge changes from a feature branch into the main branch, handling conflicts interactively and pushing changes to the remote repository.
#   It streamlines the process of conflict resolution and ensures that conflicts are addressed before committing and pushing changes.
