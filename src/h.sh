# allow_execute_perm function
# Grants execute permission to the specified file or directory.
#
# Usage:
#   allow_execute_perm <file/dir>
#
# Description:
#   The 'allow_execute_perm' function sets the execute permission for the specified <file/dir>.
#   This is useful for making a script or binary executable.
#
# Parameters:
#   - file/dir: The path to the file or directory for which execute permission is to be granted.
#
# Example:
#   allow_execute_perm ./my_script.sh
#
# Recommendations:
#   - Use this function responsibly and only on files that should be executable.
#   - Ensure that granting execute permission is necessary for the specified file or directory.

# Grants full permissions (read, write, and execute) to the specified file or directory.
#
# Usage:
#   allow_full_perm <file/dir>
#
# Description:

#   This provides read, write, and execute permissions to the owner, group, and others.
#
# Parameters:
#   - file/dir: The path to the file or directory for which full permissions are to be granted.
#
# Example:
#   allow_full_perm ./my_script.sh
#
# Recommendations:
#   - Use this function responsibly and only on files or directories that require full permissions.
#   - Granting full permissions should be done with caution, especially for security-sensitive files.
